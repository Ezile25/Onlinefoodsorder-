## Onlinefoodsorder Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between demographic and location factors and online food ordering behavior. Additionally, it seeks to analyze customer feedback to improve service quality and potentially predict customer preferences or behavior based on demographic and location attributes.

### Data Sources
onlinefoods: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the onlinefoods.csv file.This dataset includes demographic information (such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, and educational qualifications), location data (latitude, longitude, and pin code), as well as details about ordering behavior (output, feedback). 

### Tools 
-Excel - Data Cleaning

-Jupyter Notebook - Data analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation 
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

-Data loading and inspection

-Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA provided valuable insights into the demographics and behaviors of online food users

Age Distribution: The box and whisker plot shows that the majority of online food users are young, with a median age of 24 and a range from 18 to 32. This suggests that online food ordering is more popular among younger individuals.

Gender Distribution: There are more male users of the online food platform, indicating a gender skew in the user base. This finding can help tailor marketing efforts to appeal more to males, potentially expanding the user base.

Relationship between Age and Family Size: The scatterplot analysis reveals no strong relationship between age and family size among online food users. This suggests that age may not be a major factor influencing family size when it comes to online food services.

Outliers: The presence of outliers, such as a 25-year-old with a family size of 6, indicates potential market opportunities for online food platforms to target larger families with tailored offerings.

### Data Analysis
### Descriptive Statistics
Age: The dataset's age distribution shows a median age of 24, ranging from 18 to 32 years old. The mean age is 24.63 years, with a standard deviation of about 2.1 years.
Family Size: The average family size among online food users is 3.3, with a standard deviation of 1.35. The median family size is 3, with a range of 5.

### Gender Distribution Analysis
This Bar chart shows that there are more males using the online foods platform than females.

### Age Distribution Analysis
This Box and whisker reveals that online food users are predominantly young, with the majority falling between 18 and 32 years old.

### Relationship between Age and Family Size Analysis

The lack of a strong relationship between age and family size among online food users indicates that age may not be a significant factor influencing family size when it comes to online food services.

### Conclusion
Box and whisker

The graph indicates that a majority of online food users are in the younger age demographic. The median  age is 24, and people's ages range from 18 to 32. This shows that most people who order food online are young. The skewness of the data is right skewed and shows that there are few individuals in the dataset which are older and represented by the outliers on the right side of the whisker compared to those who are younger, bulk of the data on the left side.

Bar Chart

This Bar chart shows that there are more males using the online foods platform. Online foods can tailor its marketing efforts to appeal more to males. They can include showcasing food options that are more popular on makes. Online foods scan also work on attracting more female users to expand the user base.

Scatterplot

On this scatter plot there isnâ€™t a strong clear relationship between age and family size. Suggesting that age is not a major factor influencing family size when it comes to online foods services. Most individuals using the online-foods for ordering are at the ages 20 to 32. This is shown by the denser concentration of data points in this range. There is an outlier of a 25 year old with a large family of 6 which is unusual compared to their age group. This outlier shows that there is a market opportunity for online foods to target larger families, family meal plans or discounts could be offered to cater to this segment.

### Reflections
Doing descriptive statistics with python was easier as I wrote a code to do calculations unlike excel where I had to manually do the calculations. Excel is easier to use learn and does not require any coding skills. Whereas with python you need knowledge in the language to be able to do work with it for data analysis.

I would use python for working with complex data because it has many helpful libraries and tools like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for analyzing and manipulating the data. I would use Excel for fast and easy analysis, or for tasks that need a more interactive and nice-looking display. 

If I had to redo this assignment, I'd utilize seaborn or matplotlib to create visual representations that demonstrate the data effectively. This can help us understand the information better. In addition, I will keep relying on pandas for convenient data handling. I would also focus on learning more about statistics to make my analysis more detailed and accurate.

In terms of gaps in my programming or stats knowledge. I want to get better at using Python libraries that are made for analyzing data. Studying statistical functions in Python will help me understand statistical concepts better. I want to learn how to deal with data that has missing values. This includes cleaning up the data and filling in any missing information, so that the results of my analysis are accurate and trustworthy.
