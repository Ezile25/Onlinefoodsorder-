## Onlinefoodsorder Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between demographic and location factors and online food ordering behavior. Additionally, it seeks to analyze customer feedback to improve service quality and potentially predict customer preferences or behavior based on demographic and location attributes.

### Data Sources
onlinefoods: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the onlinefoods.csv file.This dataset includes demographic information (such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, and educational qualifications), location data (latitude, longitude, and pin code), as well as details about ordering behavior (output, feedback). 

### Tools 
-Excel - Data Cleaning

-Jupyter Notebook - Data analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation 
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA provided valuable insights into the demographics and behaviors of online food users

Age Distribution: The box and whisker plot shows that the majority of online food users are young, with a median age of 24 and a range from 18 to 32. This suggests that online food ordering is more popular among younger individuals.

Gender Distribution: There are more male users of the online food platform, indicating a gender skew in the user base. This finding can help tailor marketing efforts to appeal more to males, potentially expanding the user base.

Relationship between Age and Family Size: The scatterplot analysis reveals no strong relationship between age and family size among online food users. This suggests that age may not be a major factor influencing family size when it comes to online food services.

Outliers: The presence of outliers, such as a 25-year-old with a family size of 6, indicates potential market opportunities for online food platforms to target larger families with tailored offerings.
